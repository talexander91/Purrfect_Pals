# Purrfect_Pals
## Description

    Purrfect Pals is an app we designed to bring together people who have a passion for our furry little friends. We wanted to create a space where people cant come together and discuss different breeds of cats and their temperments and find local shelter to be able to adopt from.


## Usage

    As a User, you will be able to singup/login and be ablke to discuss different types of cat breeds with other Users. Each breed will have a discussion board that will have a short description about the breed as well as a link to the breed on wikipedia to get more information, and also a link to find local shelters in your area to adopt.

    Not only will each discussion board contain links to more information, but Users can also post and comment and even upload photos to chat with other Users about their cats.
